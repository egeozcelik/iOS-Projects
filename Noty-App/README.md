## How can I be sure of the reliability of the note I bought?

After our users share their notes, they are reviewed by our team. After approval from the review, it is presented to you in a form that can be purchased. However, when suspicious information is detected, you can send a report to get it reviewed again or give a low score. High-score grades are higher up on the homepage, and their reliability is high.

## So how can I monetize my notes?

1) If you're that person everyone wants their notes on:

If you are sure that your notes or articles is readable by other users and after checking the accuracy of the information you have written, you can convert the subject summaries you have prepared into noty format with the help of the camera or with the help of pdf to noty button from within the application.

2) Now it's time to create a preview:

In order to inform other users of the content of your note, it will be in your best interest to preview a few of your pages so that everyone can see them. Use the pages that best summarize your note, such as the topics you've summarized in this preview, the graphics you've drawn, and the formulas you've used. If you do not choose a preview pages, your grade will be less reliable for other users. If you keep the preview pages too much, this time the users who will buy your note will decrease.

3) And finally, setting the fee:

After you have prepared everything, you can select the price of your noty as 5tl, 10tl, 15tl, 20tl in proportion to the effort you put into preparing it, and send it for examination.

Everything is ok, now you can check your account day by day!
